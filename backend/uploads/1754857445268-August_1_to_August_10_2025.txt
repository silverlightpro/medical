Details about this test:
 
Site or sample tested: SERUM
Ordered by: SAMUEL TEKESTE
Location: LOMA-LINDA.MED.VA.GOV
Date completed: August 7, 2025, 12:00 p.m.
Provider notes: eGFR CKD-EPI
Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) calculated using the
2021 Chronic Kidney Disease-Epidemiology (CKD-EPI) Collaboration
creatinine equation; units of measure are mL/min/1.73 m2.
Results are only valid for adults (>=18 years) whose serum
creatinine is in a steady state.  eGFR calculations are not valid
for patients with acute kidney injury and for patients on dialysis.
Creatinine-based estimates of kidney function may also be
inaccurate in patients with reduced creatinine generation due to
decreased muscle mass (e.g., malnutrition, severe hypoalbuminemia,
sarcopenia, chronic neuromuscular disease, amputations, severe
heart failure or liver disease) and in patients with increased
creatinine generation due to increased muscle mass (e.g., muscle
builders, anabolic steroids) or increased dietary intake.
As drug clearance is proportional to total GFR and not GFR indexed
to body surface area (BSA), in individuals with a BSA substantially
different than 1.73 m2, drug dosing should be based on the reported
eGFR value de-indexed from BSA by multiplying by the individual's
BSA and dividing by 1.73.
CKD is diagnosed based on abnormalities of kidney structure or
function, present for >3 months, with implications for health and
disease. CKD is classified and staged based on cause, eGFR and
albuminuria (quantified as urine albumin to creatinine ratio). An
eGFR >60 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the absence of increased urine albumin
excretion or structural abnormalities does not represent CKD.

eGFR value de-indexed from BSA by multiplying by the individual's
BSA and dividing by 1.73.
CKD is diagnosed based on abnormalities of kidney structure or
function, present for >3 months, with implications for health and
disease. CKD is classified and staged based on cause, eGFR and
albuminuria (quantified as urine albumin to creatinine ratio). An
eGFR >60 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the absence of increased urine albumin
excretion or structural abnormalities does not represent CKD.

Site or sample tested: SERUM
Ordered by: PRASHANTH GOWDA
Location: LOMA-LINDA.MED.VA.GOV
Date completed: August 1, 2025, 11:15 a.m.
Provider notes: eGFR CKD-EPI
Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) calculated using the
2021 Chronic Kidney Disease-Epidemiology (CKD-EPI) Collaboration
creatinine equation; units of measure are mL/min/1.73 m2.
Results are only valid for adults (>=18 years) whose serum
creatinine is in a steady state.  eGFR calculations are not valid
for patients with acute kidney injury and for patients on dialysis.
Creatinine-based estimates of kidney function may also be
inaccurate in patients with reduced creatinine generation due to
decreased muscle mass (e.g., malnutrition, severe hypoalbuminemia,
sarcopenia, chronic neuromuscular disease, amputations, severe
heart failure or liver disease) and in patients with increased
creatinine generation due to increased muscle mass (e.g., muscle
builders, anabolic steroids) or increased dietary intake.
As drug clearance is proportional to total GFR and not GFR indexed
to body surface area (BSA), in individuals with a BSA substantially
different than 1.73 m2, drug dosing should be based on the reported
eGFR value de-indexed from BSA by multiplying by the individual's
BSA and dividing by 1.73.
CKD is diagnosed based on abnormalities of kidney structure or
function, present for >3 months, with implications for health and
disease. CKD is classified and staged based on cause, eGFR and
albuminuria (quantified as urine albumin to creatinine ratio). An
eGFR >60 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the absence of increased urine albumin
excretion or structural abnormalities does not represent CKD.

EXCERPT FROM HOSPITALIST'S PROGRESS NOTE 7/29/25:
"David Michael Lee is a 78 year old male with PMH sig for chronic hypoxemic 
respiratory failure in the setting of COPD/emphysema on 2L NC, HFpEF (5/21/25: 
EF 55-60%), a fib and sick sinus syndrome s/p Biotronik dual chamber pacemaker 
on Rivaroxaban, HTN, HLD, OSA, LLE DVT, and anxiety transferring from Barstow 
Community Hospital on 06/12/25 for acute on chronic hypoxemic respiratory 
failure, likely 2/2 COPD exacerbation in the setting of CAP. He was also 
reported to have taken 10-11 Diazepams at home because he was "tired of being 
sick."
 Impression for CHEST SINGLE VIEW , 07/30/25, case 203
Slight costophrenic angle blunting, possibly tiny effusions which
could indicate fluid overload versus underlying scar. Linear
atelectasis/scar at the lung bases. The remainder of the lungs
are clear.

WBC: 7.38on 8/7/25

RESPIRATORY STATUS: 2L O2 via nasal cannula 

SUBJECTIVE:
Mr. Lee was seen at bedside for dysphagia follow up. He was awake and alert. 

OBJECTIVE: SLP worked with veteran on incentive spirometry again, again he was 
satting at 93 upon entry of SLP and after using IS foe 10 reps his sats were 
97.  Veteran without complaints of shortness of breath at this time but said he 
goes on bi-papa when he is feeling short of breath. 

SLP worked with ice chip  trial and swallow therapy, Mr. Lee participated well 
with all therapy and did experience intermitted mild dyspnea. He is able to work 
through with breathing/swallow coordination exercises, He trialed  some tsps. of 
thins with swish and swallow with 2 effortful swallows. 
Pt also performed swallow exercises with   effortful swallows 
Veteran also used his incentive spirometry and pulled 2000 with optimal range
SLP will continue to follow


RECOMMENDATIONS/PLAN OF CARE: If consistent with patient/family/medical team 
goals of care, consider the following: 
1  Continue alternative means of nutrition, hydration, and medication. consider 
4 cups of ice chips a day 
2. Speech pathology will continue to follow closely

EF 55-60%), a fib and sick sinus syndrome s/p Biotronik dual chamber 
pacemaker on Rivaroxaban, HTN, HLD, OSA, LLE DVT, and anxiety, transferred 
from Barstow Community Hospital on 06/12/25 for acute on chronic hypoxemic 
respiratory failure, likely 2/2 COPD exacerbation in the setting of CAP. He 
was also reported to have taken 10-11 Diazepams at home because he was "tired 
of being sick", leading to acute metabolic encephalopathy and suicidal 
ideation, which has since resolved. Patient was initially admitted to medical 
floor,then upgraded to MICU due to respiratory failure s/p 
intubation(6/15-6/19).
His respiratory status has since been managed with AVAPS and BiPAP therapy, 
and he has been weaned to 2-3L NC oxygen. Peg tube was placed on 7/16/25 by 
IR due to dysphagia and patient has been on tube feeding since. SLP 
following,still recommending NPO with alternative feeding route

Interdisciplinary meeting held on 8/6/25 in patient`s room
Participants:
-Patient and his son(David Lee Jr, who has the POA)
-Myself
-Rosana dagostino(nurse manager)
-Brittany Watson(discharge planner)
-Lisa Bill(Social worker)

We discussed in detail about the patient`s hospital course since he was 
transferred from outside hospital on 6/12/25. We discussed that the patient 
has remarkably improved clinically, and at this time, he is medically stable 
for discharge to a rehab facility( has been medically stable since last 
week), and that there is no active medical need for the patient to stay in 
the hospital any longer; that the most important thing the patient needs at 
this time is rehab; that the recovery process will be slow as the patient has 
been hospitalized for a prolonged period of time; that all the nursing care 
the patient needs can be provided at a skilled care facility.
The son generally agreed with our assessment, but he said he does not like 
the skilled nursing care facilities recommended by our social services staff. 
He insisted that he needs more time to make sure his farther remains 
stableprior to discharge and to find a skilled nursing care facility that 
he(the son) feels would be appropriate for his father.

A due process has been initiated


Dvt Prophylaxis: Apixaban 
CONDITION:       Stable 
CODE STATUS:     Full Code 
DISCHARGE PLAN:  Patient isstable for discharge to SNF for rehab

Diagnostic Impressions (DSM-V, ICD-10): 
Counseling, unspecified (ICD-10-CM Z71.9)
Clinician:  Lisa A. Bill, LCSW, MPH
Duration: 15 minutes

CONSENTS: The purpose of social work referral/visit was explained.
Confidentiality and the limits of confidentiality, including duties as a
mandated reporter, were discussed with the patient who understood and 
provided verbal consent.

Background: Patient is in need of a skilled nursing facility for rehab. Two 
facilities have accepted patient. Patient's son declined to have patient 
discharge to either. Due process was begun on 8/6/25. 

Intervention:
SW received email from patient's son, David Jr. who stated he had come to the 
conclusion that getting patient into an acceptable rehab facility as soon as 
possible would be the best thing for patient. He further stated he would like 
patient referred to SNFs in the Barstow area as that is where patient lives and 
where he has his support system. SW replied to patient's email and informed him 
SW had expanded referral to four SNFs within 50 miles of Barstow (as there are 
only five and one has already declined patient). 

Referred to:
Mountain View Post Acute/Rimrock Villa - Placed call to AC Cindy who stated 
she had not yet reviewed referral, but would do so and call this SW back. Cindy 
called back and stated Mountain View would not have a bed until 8/11, but 
that their "sister facility" Comm. Care & Rehab in Riverside would be happy 
to take patient for a few days and then transfer him to Mountain View when 
the bed becomes available. 
Apple Valley Care Center - SW placed call to AC Daniel who had not yet 
reviewed referral. Stated he would and would call this SW back. SW awaits 
response.
Spring Valley Post Acute - SW spoke with Mirella who requested documentation 
that patient is no longer on restraints. SW requested attending amend his prog 
note to articulate patient is no longer on restraints. Attending did so and SW 
sent to Spring Valley. SW awaits response
Knolls West Post - LVM for Christina 
Re-referred to:
Grand Terrace - can accept
Vista Real - no response
Riverside Heights - no response
Premier Care of Palm Springs - no response

PLAN: SW to present the accepting SNFs to patient's son.

Facility and home medication list reviewed and considered.

Medications with significant nutritional interactions: none
Pertinent medications: INSULIN, D50, DOCUSATE, SENNA 

Estimated Nutrient Needs: (Based on (84 KG) ADJUSTED BODY WEIGHT)
Calories:       (2100-2520) kcalories / (25-30) kcalories per kg
Protein:        (101-118) grams / (1.2-1.4) grams per kg
Fluids:         1 mL per kcalories
Current diet plan provides adequate nutrition to meet estimated nutrient needs


NUTRITION DIAGNOSIS:
- Inadequate EN intake related to tube feeds not infusing at goal rate as
  evidenced by patient not meeting estimated nutrition needs (improved) 

- Swallowing Difficulty related to dysphagia as evidenced by medical 
  diagnosis (ongoing) 

- Increased Nutrient needs related to wound healing as evidenced by 
  patient with 2 pressure injuries (ongoing) 


NUTRITION INTERVENTIONS:
- Continue NPO 

- Continue TF rx:
  Jevity 1.5 at 65 ml/hr  with 20ml/hr auto water flush
  This goal rate provides:
  1430 ml formula 
  2145 kcal + 80 kcal ProSource BID + 40 kcal Fibercel TID = 2345 total kcal 
  92g  PRO + 22g ProSource BID = 114 g PRO
  309g CHO
  1527 ml Total water (1087 ml from formula + 440 ml free water flush)
  ***Depending on hydration status, additional free water may be needed
  ***Water flush: 20 ml/hr auto flushes

- Continue with enteral nutrition supplement: Prosource BID
        -appropriate, pt w/ increase nutrient needs 

-Prosource 1 pkt 
        -> each pkt provides: 11g of protein, <1 gm CHO, and 40 kcal

- Will provide with enteral nutrition supplement: Fibercel BID 
        -appropriate, pt with diarrhea 

- Banatrol 1 pkt 
        -> each pkt provides: 2g fiber, 0g pro, 15 mg Na, 125g K, 40 kcal


NUTRITION MONITORING AND RE-EVALUATION CRITERIA:
- Nutrition intakes will provide >75% of estimated nutritional needs

Veteran has been reevaluated and found to be at moderate nutritional risk at
this time and is scheduled for follow-up per the VALL Nutrition & Food Services
standards of practice. Re-evaluation may occur sooner as per the clinical
judgement of the Registered Dietitian or as consulted by medical staff.

      Moisture -- degree to which skin is exposed to moisture
      Occasionally moist.

      Activity -- ability to change and control body position
      Chair fast.

      Mobility -- ability to change and control body position
      Slightly limited.

      Nutrition -- usual food intake patterns
      Adequate.

      Friction and shear
      Problem.

    INTERVENTIONS: 
      New or changed pressure ulcer/injury interventions or medical condition.
      Education:
        Provide patient/caregiver education regarding causes and prevention of
        pressure ulcers/injuries.
        Provide patient/caregiver education regarding treatment plan for
        pressure ulcers/injuries.
        Teach patient/caregiver importance of changing position frequently for
        pressure ulcer/injury prevention.
      Pressure-Redistribution measures:
        Turn and reposition every two hours while in bed
      Maximize mobilization:
        Encourage activity as tolerated
      Manage moisture:
        Maintain clean and dry skin
      Manage nutrition:
        Monitor fluid/food intake
      Reduce friction and shear:
        Elevate head of bed for meals, then lower within one hour after eating
        (unless contraindicated)

    RISK FACTORS THAT INCREASE RISK FOR DEVELOPING PRESSURE INJURIES:
    The patient/resident has the following:
      Age over 75
      Device(s): (nasogastric tubes, oxygen tubing, urinary catheters, cell
      phone etc.)
        Comment: piv, foley cath and oxygen tubing

"David Michael Lee is a 78 year old male with PMH sig for chronic hypoxemic 
respiratory failure in the setting of COPD/emphysema on 2L NC, HFpEF (5/21/25: 
EF 55-60%), a fib and sick sinus syndrome s/p Biotronik dual chamber pacemaker 
on Rivaroxaban, HTN, HLD, OSA, LLE DVT, and anxiety transferring from Barstow 
Community Hospital on 06/12/25 for acute on chronic hypoxemic respiratory 
failure, likely 2/2 COPD exacerbation in the setting of CAP. He was also 
reported to have taken 10-11 Diazepams at home because he was "tired of being 
sick."
 Impression for CHEST SINGLE VIEW , 07/30/25, case 203
Slight costophrenic angle blunting, possibly tiny effusions which
could indicate fluid overload versus underlying scar. Linear
atelectasis/scar at the lung bases. The remainder of the lungs
are clear.

WBC: 7.38on 8/7/25

RESPIRATORY STATUS: 2L O2 via nasal cannula 

SUBJECTIVE:
Mr. Lee was seen at bedside for dysphagia follow up. He was awake and alert. 

OBJECTIVE: SLP worked with veteran on incentive spirometry again, again he was 
satting at 93 upon entry of SLP and after using IS foe 10 reps his sats were 
97-98, Veteran without complaints of shortness of breath. 

SLP worked with ice chip  trial and swallow therapy, Mr. Lee participated well 
with all therapy and did experience intermitted mild dyspnea. He is able to work 
through with breathing/swallow coordination exercises, He trialed  some tsps. of 
thins with swish and swallow with 2 effortful swallows. 
Pt also performed swallow exercises with 5 effortful swallows and got short of 
breath after 5 swallows so we took a break and repeated same for duration of tx. 
Veteran also used his incentive spirometry and pulled 2000 with optimal range
SLP will continue to follow


RECOMMENDATIONS/PLAN OF CARE: If consistent with patient/family/medical team 
goals of care, consider the following: 
1  Continue alternative means of nutrition, hydration, and medication. consider 
2 cups of ice chips a day 
2. Speech pathology will continue to follow closely

of being sick", leading to acute metabolic encephalopathy and suicidal 
ideation, which has since resolved. Patient was initially admitted to medical 
floor,then upgraded to MICU due to respiratory failure s/p 
intubation(6/15-6/19).
His respiratory status has since been managed with AVAPS and BiPAP therapy, 
and he has been weaned to 2-3L NC oxygen. Peg tube was placed on 7/16/25 by 
IR due to dysphagia and patient has been on tube feeding since. SLP 
following,still recommending NPO with alternative feeding route
 A liver mass and incidental lung nodule require further 
evaluation. His code status was changed to FULL CODE by his son. 
Pt's encephalpathy has been improving and likely has reached his baseline 
mental status.


# Acute Metabolic Encephalopathy: resolved
Likely secondary to hypercapnia vs. delirium.
A&Ox3, improved, likely back to baseline
CT Head (06/23): Unremarkable.


#Chronic Diazepam Use and Overdose
- Overdose on 10-11 Diazepam pills prior to admission.
#. Suicidal Ideation and Attempt
- Psychiatry evaluated patient:  no current suicidal ideation
- 1:1 sitter discontinued per psychiatry recommendation.
- Continue Melatonin 3mg PO QHS.

# Acute on chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure.  Acute respiratory 
failure has resolved
# COPD with emphysematous changes.
# OSA with questionable CPAP adherence.
- S/p Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation with BiPAP therapy 
- S/p intubation 6/15-6/19
- S/p prednisone 40 mg NGT (06/16-06/17)
-continue AVAPS QHS and during naps.
-Use AVAPS during the day if needed for increased work of breathing.
-Continue oxygen 2L/min
- Astral BIPAP machine was delivered to the patient by pulmonary, 7/28/2025. 
Settings were programmed and patient tolerated it. 
-Continue budesonide/formoterol, tiotropium, levalbuterol as needed


# Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF)
- EF 55-60%, not in acute exacerbation.
- DCed Empagliflozin 12.5 mg PO daily from 7/30 due to lower trending of BP 
and lower trending of electrolytes
- spot dose Furosemide prn, limited by low/normal BP 

# Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation and Sick Sinus Syndrome
- On Apixaban 5mg BID 
- Rate controlled; continue Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg PEG bid

# Hyperlipidemia 
- continue Simvsatatin 10mg PEG daily 

Nutritional and GI Issues:
#Hypoalbuminemia, likely secondary to malnutrition.
#PEG tube placed (7/16), Jevity 1.5 feeding.
# Dysphagia, high aspiration risk; NPO except water.
- speech following
- aspiration precautions

# Constipation,resolved
Continue bowel regimen with docusate/senna and Miralax.


# Urinary retention s/p foley cath use
- Required straight cath x 2 (6/22/25)
- foley reinserted 6/23/25
- Failed a voiding trial on 7/16/25, re-inserted on 7/17/25
- Foley exchanged 7/29/25, continue to monitor

# Normocytic Anemia: stable, HGB stable, no bleeding
- Hgb ranges 8-10


# I.D. 
Sputum AmpC+ Serratia Marcescens: contact isolation.
Citrobacter koseri bacteremia likely contaminant per I.D. 
Monitor for signs of infection.

# Wound/at risk for infection
- L EAR & NOSE:
        -Keep skin clean and dry 
        -Use Allevyn 2x4 to off load pressure and decrease friction from mask 
        straps (Apply directly to straps)
        -use gel pad to nasal bridge if bipap mask is required 
- NASAL BRIDGE ulcer & L EAR: 
        -Daily wound care
        -Cleanse with normal saline
        -Cover affected area w/ small piece of Calcium Alginate 
        -Secure with cut Allevyn 2x4

# Generalized weakness secondary to deconditioning from hospitalization. 
-PT working with patient

# incidental imaging findings
Liver Mass 4.3cm
CT triple scan order, pending (unable to do 2/2 to barium from speech swallow 
test still showing on KUB) 
Plan for outptaient work up

#  Incidental Findings
- 6 mm nodule in right lower lobe; follow-up chest CT in 6 months.
Punctate stones in left kidney and bladder calculi; outpatient follow-up.

Interdisciplinary meeting held on 8/6/25 in patient`s room
Participants:
-Patient and his son(David Lee Jr, who has the POA)
-Myself
-Rosana dagostino(nurse manager)
-Brittany Watson(discharge planner)
-Lisa Bill(Social worker)

We discussed in detail about the patient`s hospital course since he was 
transferred from outside hospital on 6/12/25. We discussed that the patient 
has remarkably improved clinically, and at this time, he is medically stable 
for discharge to a rehab facility( has been medically stable since last 
week), and that there is no active medical need for the patient to stay in 
the hospital any longer; that the most important thing the patient needs at 
this time is rehab; that the recovery process will be slow as the patient has 
been hospitalized for a prolonged period of time; that all the nursing care 
the patient needs can be provided at a skilled care facility.
The son generally agreed with our assessment, but he said he does not like 
the skilled nursing care facilities recommended by our social services staff. 
He insisted that he needs more time to make sure his farther remains 
stableprior to discharge and to find a skilled nursing care facility that 
he(the son) feels would be appropriate for his father.

A due process has been initiated


Dvt Prophylaxis: Apixaban 
CONDITION:       Stable 
CODE STATUS:     Full Code 
DISCHARGE PLAN:  Patient isstable for discharge to SNF for rehab

      Skin Moisture:
        Normal
      Skin Turgor:
        Elastic (normal)
 
Braden Skin Assessment:
      The patient's Braden Scale Score is 16. The patient is at mild risk for 
      development of pressure ulcer/injury.

      Sensory perception -- ability to respond meaningfully to pressure-
related 
      discomfort
      No impairment.

      Moisture -- degree to which skin is exposed to moisture
      Occasionally moist.

      Activity -- ability to change and control body position
      Chair fast.

      Mobility -- ability to change and control body position
      Slightly limited.

      Nutrition -- usual food intake patterns
      Adequate.

      Friction and shear
      Problem.

    INTERVENTIONS: 
      New or changed pressure ulcer/injury interventions or medical condition.
      Education:
        Provide patient/caregiver education regarding causes and prevention of
        pressure ulcers/injuries.
        Provide patient/caregiver education regarding treatment plan for
        pressure ulcers/injuries.
        Teach patient/caregiver importance of changing position frequently for
        pressure ulcer/injury prevention.
      Pressure-Redistribution measures:
        Turn and reposition every two hours while in bed
      Maximize mobilization:
        Encourage activity as tolerated
      Manage moisture:
        Maintain clean and dry skin
      Manage nutrition:
        Monitor fluid/food intake
      Reduce friction and shear:
        Elevate head of bed for meals, then lower within one hour after eating

Hypoenhancing structure in the anterior periphery of the liver
measuring approximately 4.3 cm, indeterminate, could represent
hepatic infarct or infectious process versus hepatic lesion.
Recommend liver protocol MRI or CT for further evaluation.
Punctate stones in the mid pole of the left kidney. Urinary
bladder decompressed by Foley catheter. Urinary bladder calculi
are present, largest cluster measuring approximately 2.8 cm.
There is gas in the lumen of the urinary bladder which could be
due to recent instrumentation versus gas forming infection.
6 mm nodule right lower lobe. Recommend follow-up chest CT in 6
months.
Mild left basilar consolidations which could be
infectious/inflammatory versus atelectasis.
Other findings as described. See findings section.

A/P:
=============================================================================
78 y/o male with PMH sig for chronic hypoxemic 
respiratory failure 2/2 COPD/emphysema on 2L NC, HFpEF (5/21/25: 
EF 55-60%), a fib and sick sinus syndrome s/p Biotronik dual chamber 
pacemaker on Rivaroxaban, HTN, HLD, OSA, LLE DVT, and anxiety, transferred 
from Barstow Community Hospital on 06/12/25 for acute on chronic hypoxemic 
respiratory failure, likely 2/2 COPD exacerbation in the setting of CAP. He 
was also reported to have taken 10-11 Diazepams at home because he was "tired 
of being sick", leading to acute metabolic encephalopathy and suicidal 
ideation, which has since resolved. Patient was initially admitted to medical 
floor,then upgraded to MICU due to respiratory failure s/p 
intubation(6/15-6/19).
His respiratory status has since been managed with AVAPS and BiPAP therapy, 
and he has been weaned to 2L NC oxygen. Peg tube was placed on 7/16/25 by IR 
due to dysphagia and patient has been on tube feeding since. SLP 
following,still recommending NPO with alternative feeding route
 A liver mass and incidental lung nodule require further 
evaluation. His code status was changed to FULL CODE by his son. 
Pt's encephalpathy has been improving and likely has reached to his baseline 
of having memory issue. 


# Acute Metabolic Encephalopathy: resolved
Likely secondary to hypercapnia vs. delirium.
A&Ox2, improved, likely back to baseline
CT Head (06/23): Unremarkable.


#Chronic Diazepam Use and Overdose
- Overdose on 10-11 Diazepam pills prior to admission.
#. Suicidal Ideation and Attempt
- Psychiatry evaluated patient:  no current suicidal ideation
- 1:1 sitter discontinued per psychiatry recommendation.
- Continue Melatonin 3mg PO QHS.

# Acute on chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure.  Acute respiratory 
failure 
has resolved
# COPD with emphysematous changes.
# OSA with questionable CPAP adherence.
- S/p Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation with BiPAP therapy 
- S/p intubation 6/15-6/19
- S/p prednisone 40 mg NGT (06/16-06/17)
-continue AVAPS QHS and during naps.
-Use AVAPS during the day if needed for increased work of breathing.
-Continue oxygen 2L/min, wean as tolerated for SpO2 goal 88-92%.
- Astral BIPAP machine was delivered to the patient by pulmonary, 7/28/2025. 
Settings were programmed and patient tolerated it. 
-Continue budesonide/formoterol, tiotropium, levalbuterol as needed


# Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF)
- EF 55-60%, not in acute exacerbation.
- DCed Empagliflozin 12.5 mg PO daily from 7/30 due to lower trending of BP 
and lower trending of electrolytes
- spot dose Furosemide prn, limited by low/normal BP 

# Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation and Sick Sinus Syndrome
- On Apixaban 5mg BID 
- Rate controlled; continue Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg PEG bid

# Hyperlipidemia 
- continue Simvsatatin 10mg PEG daily 

Nutritional and GI Issues:
#Hypoalbuminemia, likely secondary to malnutrition.
#PEG tube placed (7/16), Jevity 1.5 feeding.
# Dysphagia, high aspiration risk; NPO except water.
- speech following, multiple swallow studies, last 8/5/25
- f/u with speech 
- aspiration precautions

# Constipation
Continue bowel regimen with docusate/senna and Miralax.


# Urinary retention s/p foley cath use
- Required straight cath x 2 (6/22/25)
- foley reinserted 6/23/25
- Failed a voiding trial on 7/16/25, re-inserted on 7/17/25
- Foley exchanged 7/29/25, continue to monitor

# Normocytic Anemia: stable, HGB stable, no bleeding
- Hgb ranges 8-10
- Transfuse as needed for goal Hgb > 7 

# I.D. 
Sputum AmpC+ Serratia Marcescens: contact isolation.
Citrobacter koseri bacteremia likely contaminant per I.D. 
Monitor for signs of infection.

# Wound/at risk for infection
- L EAR & NOSE:
        -Keep skin clean and dry 
        -Use Allevyn 2x4 to off load pressure and decrease friction from mask 
        straps (Apply directly to straps)
        -use gel pad to nasal bridge if bipap mask is required 
- NASAL BRIDGE ulcer & L EAR: 
        -Daily wound care
        -Cleanse with normal saline
        -Cover affected area w/ small piece of Calcium Alginate

# Generalized weakness secondary to deconditioning from hospitalization. 
PM&R 
consult and f/u appreciated

# incidental imaging findings
Liver Mass 4.3cm
CT triple scan order, pending (unable to do 2/2 to barium from speech swallow 
test still showing on KUB) 
Plan for outptaient work up

#  Incidental Findings
- 6 mm nodule in right lower lobe; follow-up chest CT in 6 months.
Punctate stones in left kidney and bladder calculi; outpatient follow-up.

Interdisciplinary meeting held today(8/6/25) in patient`s room
Participants:
-Patient and his son(David Lee Jr, who has the POA)
-Myself
-Rosana dagostino(nurse manager)
-Brittany Watson(discharge planner)
-Lisa Bill(Social worker)

We discussed in detail about the patient`s hospital course since he was 
transferred from outside hospital on 6/12/25. We discussed that the patient 
has remarkably improved clinically, and at this time, he is medically stable 
for discharge to a rehab facility( has been medically stable since last 
week), and that there is no active medical need for the patient to stay in 
the hospital any longer; that the most important thing the patient needs at 
this time is rehab; that the recovery process will be slow as the patient has 
been hospitalized for a prolonged period of time; that all the nursing care 
the patient needs can be provided at a skilled care facility.
The son generally agreed with our assessment, but he said he does not like 
the skilled nursing care facilities recommended by our social services staff. 
He insisted that he needs more time to make sure his farther remains 
stableprior to discharge and to find a skilled nursing care facility that 
he(the son) feels would be appropriate for his father.





Dvt Prophylaxis: Apixaban 
CONDITION:       [] Stable [x] Seriously ill (informed)
PROGNOSIS:       Indeterminant (informed)
CODE STATUS:     [x] Full Code [] DNR-see separate note
DISCHARGE PLAN:  Patient is now stable for discharge to SNF for rehab

EXCERPT FROM HOSPITALIST'S PROGRESS NOTE 7/29/25:
"David Michael Lee is a 78 year old male with PMH sig for chronic hypoxemic 
respiratory failure in the setting of COPD/emphysema on 2L NC, HFpEF (5/21/25: 
EF 55-60%), a fib and sick sinus syndrome s/p Biotronik dual chamber pacemaker 
on Rivaroxaban, HTN, HLD, OSA, LLE DVT, and anxiety transferring from Barstow 
Community Hospital on 06/12/25 for acute on chronic hypoxemic respiratory 
failure, likely 2/2 COPD exacerbation in the setting of CAP. He was also 
reported to have taken 10-11 Diazepams at home because he was "tired of being 
sick."
 Impression for CHEST SINGLE VIEW , 07/30/25, case 203
Slight costophrenic angle blunting, possibly tiny effusions which
could indicate fluid overload versus underlying scar. Linear
atelectasis/scar at the lung bases. The remainder of the lungs
are clear.

WBC: 6.79 on 8/6/25

RESPIRATORY STATUS: 2L O2 via nasal cannula 

SUBJECTIVE:
Mr. Lee was seen at bedside for dysphagia follow up. He was awake and alert. 

OBJECTIVE: SLP worked with veteran on incentive spirometry again, again he was 
satting at 93 upon entry of SLP and after using IS foe 10 reps his sats were 
97-98, Veteran without complaints of shortness of breath. 

SLP worked with water trial and swallow therapy, Mr. Lee participated well with 
all therapy and did experience intermitted mild dyspnea. He is able to work 
through with breathing/swallow coordination exercises, He trialed  some tsps. of 
thins with swish and swallow with 2 effortful swallows. 
Pt also performed swallow exercises with 5 effortful swallows and got short of 
breath after 5 swallows so we took a break and repeated same for duration of tx. 
Veteran also used his incentive spirometry and pulled 2000 with optimal range
SLP will continue to follow


RECOMMENDATIONS/PLAN OF CARE: If consistent with patient/family/medical team 
goals of care, consider the following: 
1  Continue alternative means of nutrition, hydration, and medication. 
2. Speech pathology will continue to follow closely

    Assessment Type:
      SKIN REINSPECTION/REASSESSMENT

    Braden Skin Assessment:
      The patient's Braden Scale Score is 12. The patient is at high risk for 
      development of pressure ulcers/injuries.

      Sensory perception -- ability to respond meaningfully to pressure-
related 
      discomfort
      Very limited.

      Moisture -- degree to which skin is exposed to moisture
      Occasionally moist.

      Activity -- ability to change and control body position
      Bedfast.

      Mobility -- ability to change and control body position
      Very limited.

      Nutrition -- usual food intake patterns
      Probably inadequate.

      Friction and shear
      Potential problem.

    INTERVENTIONS: 
      New or changed pressure ulcer/injury interventions or medical condition.
      Education:
        Provide patient/caregiver education regarding causes and prevention of
        pressure ulcers/injuries.
        Provide patient/caregiver education regarding treatment plan for
        pressure ulcers/injuries.
        Teach patient/caregiver importance of changing position frequently for
        pressure ulcer/injury prevention.
      Pressure-Redistribution measures:
        Use pillows (or other pressure relieving devices) to separate pressure
        areas
      Maximize mobilization:
        Encourage activity as tolerated
      Manage moisture:
        Apply protective barrier ointment
        Maintain clean and dry skin
        No more than one linen layer below the patient/resident
      Manage nutrition:
        Monitor fluid/food intake
        Provide or encourage oral care prn
        Tube feeding as ordered

    RISK FACTORS THAT INCREASE RISK FOR DEVELOPING PRESSURE INJURIES:
    The patient/resident has the following:
      Age over 75
      Device(s): (nasogastric tubes, oxygen tubing, urinary catheters, cell
      phone etc.)
        Comment: NC, Foley Catheter, Heart leads, BP cuff, and pulse

are clear.

WBC: 6.21 on 8/4/25

RESPIRATORY STATUS: 2L O2 via nasal cannula 

SUBJECTIVE:
Mr. Lee was seen at bedside for dysphagia follow up. He was awake and alert. 

OBJECTIVE: SLP worked with veteran on incentive spirometry again, again he was 
satting at 91 upon entry of SLP and after using IS for 10 reps his sats were 
97-98, Veteran with less complaints of intermittent shortness of breath. 

SLP worked with water trial and swallow therapy, Mr. Lee participated well with 
all therapy and was happy to discuss his anxiety management with Dr. Tekeste. He 
is able to work through with breathing/swallow coordination exercises, He 
trialed 30 tsps. of water with 2 effortful swallows after each as well as a 
series of effortful swallows after, no notable shortness of breath today. 
Will resume thin liquid and pureed trials with SLP only at this time

LABS: reviewed
=============================================================================
CXR
Impression for CHEST SINGLE VIEW , 07/30/25, case 203
Slight costophrenic angle blunting, possibly tiny effusions which
could indicate fluid overload versus underlying scar. Linear
atelectasis/scar at the lung bases. The remainder of the lungs
are clear.

CXR
Impression for CHEST SINGLE VIEW , 07/20/25, case 47
No acute cardiopulmonary disease.

CT
Impression for CT ABDOMEN PELVIS W/CONTRAST , 07/21/25, case 203
Hypoenhancing structure in the anterior periphery of the liver
measuring approximately 4.3 cm, indeterminate, could represent
hepatic infarct or infectious process versus hepatic lesion.
Recommend liver protocol MRI or CT for further evaluation.
Punctate stones in the mid pole of the left kidney. Urinary
bladder decompressed by Foley catheter. Urinary bladder calculi
are present, largest cluster measuring approximately 2.8 cm.
There is gas in the lumen of the urinary bladder which could be
due to recent instrumentation versus gas forming infection.
6 mm nodule right lower lobe. Recommend follow-up chest CT in 6
months.
Mild left basilar consolidations which could be
infectious/inflammatory versus atelectasis.
Other findings as described. See findings section.

Ultrasound
Impression for US LOWER EXT VENOUS BILAT, 07/21/25, case 445
The common femoral, superficial femoral, popliteal veins show no
thrombus

A/P:
=============================================================================
78 y/o male with PMH sig for chronic hypoxemic 
respiratory failure 2/2 COPD/emphysema on 2L NC, HFpEF (5/21/25: 
EF 55-60%), a fib and sick sinus syndrome s/p Biotronik dual chamber pacemaker 
on Rivaroxaban, HTN, HLD, OSA, LLE DVT, and anxiety, transferred from Barstow 
Community Hospital on 06/12/25 for acute on chronic hypoxemic respiratory 
failure, likely 2/2 COPD exacerbation in the setting of CAP. He was also 
reported to have taken 10-11 Diazepams at home because he was "tired of being 
sick", leading to acute metabolic encephalopathy and suicidal ideation, which 
has since resolved. Patient was initially admitted to medical floor,then 
upgraded to MICU due to respiratory failure s/p intubation(6/15-6/19).
 His respiratory status has since been managed with AVAPS and BiPAP therapy, and 
he has been weaned to 2L NC oxygen. Peg tube was placed on 7/16/25 by IR due to 
dysphagia and patient has been on tube feeding since. SLP following,still 
recommending NPO with alternative feeding route
 A liver mass and incidental lung nodule require further 
evaluation. His code status was changed to FULL CODE by his son. 
Pt's encephalpathy has been improving and likely has reached to his baseline 
of having memory issue. 


# Acute Metabolic Encephalopathy: resolved
Likely secondary to hypercapnia vs. delirium.
A&Ox2, improved, likely back to baseline
CT Head (06/23): Unremarkable.


#Chronic Diazepam Use and Overdose
- Overdose on 10-11 Diazepam pills prior to admission.
#. Suicidal Ideation and Attempt
- Psychiatry evaluated patient:  no current suicidal ideation
- 1:1 sitter discontinued per psychiatry recommendation.
- Continue Melatonin 3mg PO QHS.

# Acute on chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure.  Acute respiratory failure 
has resolved
# COPD with emphysematous changes.
# OSA with questionable CPAP adherence.
- S/p Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation with BiPAP therapy 
- S/p intubation 6/15-6/19
- S/p prednisone 40 mg NGT (06/16-06/17)
-continue AVAPS QHS and during naps.
-Use AVAPS during the day if needed for increased work of breathing.
-Continue oxygen 2L/min, wean as tolerated for SpO2 goal 88-92%.
- Astral BIPAP machine was delivered to the patient by pulmonary, 7/28/2025. 
Settings were programmed and patient tolerated it. 
-Continue budesonide/formoterol, tiotropium, levalbuterol as needed


# Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF)
- EF 55-60%, not in acute exacerbation.
- DCed Empagliflozin 12.5 mg PO daily from 7/30 due to lower trending of BP and 
lower trending of electrolytes
- spot dose Furosemide prn, limited by low/normal BP 

# Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation and Sick Sinus Syndrome
- On Apixaban 5mg BID 
- Rate controlled; continue Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg PEG bid

# Hyperlipidemia 
- continue Simvsatatin 10mg PEG daily 

Nutritional and GI Issues:
#Hypoalbuminemia, likely secondary to malnutrition.
#PEG tube placed (7/16), Jevity 1.5 feeding.
# Dysphagia, high aspiration risk; NPO except water.
- speech following, multiple swallow studies, last 8/5/25
- f/u with speech 
- aspiration precautions

# Constipation
Continue bowel regimen with docusate/senna and Miralax.


# Urinary retention s/p foley cath use
- Required straight cath x 2 (6/22/25)
- foley reinserted 6/23/25
- Failed a voiding trial on 7/16/25, re-inserted on 7/17/25
- Foley exchanged 7/29/25, continue to monitor

# Normocytic Anemia: stable, HGB stable, no bleeding
- Hgb ranges 8-10
- Transfuse as needed for goal Hgb > 7 

# I.D. 
Sputum AmpC+ Serratia Marcescens: contact isolation.
Citrobacter koseri bacteremia likely contaminant per I.D. 
Monitor for signs of infection.

# Wound/at risk for infection
- L EAR & NOSE:
        -Keep skin clean and dry 
        -Use Allevyn 2x4 to off load pressure and decrease friction from mask 
        straps (Apply directly to straps)

=============================================================================
LABS: reviewed
=============================================================================
CXR
Impression for CHEST SINGLE VIEW , 07/30/25, case 203
Slight costophrenic angle blunting, possibly tiny effusions which
could indicate fluid overload versus underlying scar. Linear
atelectasis/scar at the lung bases. The remainder of the lungs
are clear.

CXR
Impression for CHEST SINGLE VIEW , 07/20/25, case 47
No acute cardiopulmonary disease.

CT
Impression for CT ABDOMEN PELVIS W/CONTRAST , 07/21/25, case 203
Hypoenhancing structure in the anterior periphery of the liver
measuring approximately 4.3 cm, indeterminate, could represent
hepatic infarct or infectious process versus hepatic lesion.
Recommend liver protocol MRI or CT for further evaluation.
Punctate stones in the mid pole of the left kidney. Urinary
bladder decompressed by Foley catheter. Urinary bladder calculi
are present, largest cluster measuring approximately 2.8 cm.
There is gas in the lumen of the urinary bladder which could be
due to recent instrumentation versus gas forming infection.
6 mm nodule right lower lobe. Recommend follow-up chest CT in 6
months.
Mild left basilar consolidations which could be
infectious/inflammatory versus atelectasis.
Other findings as described. See findings section.

Ultrasound
Impression for US LOWER EXT VENOUS BILAT, 07/21/25, case 445
The common femoral, superficial femoral, popliteal veins show no

A/P:
=============================================================================
78 y/o male with PMH sig for chronic hypoxemic 
respiratory failure in the setting of COPD/emphysema on 2L NC, HFpEF (5/21/25: 
EF 55-60%), a fib and sick sinus syndrome s/p Biotronik dual chamber pacemaker 
on Rivaroxaban, HTN, HLD, OSA, LLE DVT, and anxiety, transferred from Barstow 
Community Hospital on 06/12/25 for acute on chronic hypoxemic respiratory 
failure, likely 2/2 COPD exacerbation in the setting of CAP. He was also 
reported to have taken 10-11 Diazepams at home because he was "tired of being 
sick", leading to acute metabolic encephalopathy and suicidal ideation, which 
has since resolved. Patient was initially admitted to medical floor,then 
upgraded to MICU due to respiratory failure s/p intubation(6/15-6/19).
 His respiratory status has since been managed with AVAPS and BiPAP therapy, and 
he has been weaned to 2L NC oxygen. Peg tube was placed on 7/16/25 by IR due to 
dysphagia and patient has been on tube feeding since. SLP following,still 
recommending NPO with alternative feeding route
 A liver mass and incidental lung nodule require further 
evaluation. His code status was changed to FULL CODE by his son. 
Pt's encephalpathy has been improving and likely has reached to his baseline 
of having memory issue. 


# Acute Metabolic Encephalopathy: resolved
Likely secondary to hypercapnia vs. delirium.
A&Ox2, improved, likely back to baseline
CT Head (06/23): Unremarkable.


#Chronic Diazepam Use and Overdose
- Overdose on 10-11 Diazepam pills prior to admission.
#. Suicidal Ideation and Attempt
- Psychiatry evaluated patient:  no current suicidal ideation
- 1:1 sitter discontinued per psychiatry recommendation.
- Continue Melatonin 3mg PO QHS.

# Acute on chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure.  Acute respiratory failure 
has resolved
# COPD with emphysematous changes.
# OSA with questionable CPAP adherence.
- S/p Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation with BiPAP therapy 
- S/p intubation 6/15-6/19
- S/p prednisone 40 mg NGT (06/16-06/17)
-continue AVAPS QHS and during naps.
-Use AVAPS during the day if needed for increased work of breathing.
-Continue oxygen 2L/min, wean as tolerated for SpO2 goal 88-92%.
- Astral BIPAP machine was delivered to the patient by pulmonary, 7/28/2025. 
Settings were programmed and patient tolerated it. 
-Continue budesonide/formoterol, tiotropium, levalbuterol as needed


# Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF)
- EF 55-60%, not in acute exacerbation.
- DCed Empagliflozin 12.5 mg PO daily from 7/30 due to lower trending of BP and 
lower trending of electrolytes
- spot dose Furosemide prn, limited by low/normal BP 

# Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation and Sick Sinus Syndrome
- On Apixaban 5mg BID due to PEG tube.
- Rate controlled; continue Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg PEG bid

# Hyperlipidemia 
- continue Simvsatatin 10mg PEG daily 

Nutritional and GI Issues:
#Hypoalbuminemia, likely secondary to malnutrition.
#PEG tube placed (7/16), Jevity 1.5 feeding.
# Dysphagia, high aspiration risk; NPO except water.
- speech following, multiple swallow studies, last 8/4/25
- f/u with speech 
- aspiration precautions

# Constipation
Continue bowel regimen with docusate/senna and Miralax.


# Urinary retention s/p foley cath use
- Required straight cath x 2 (6/22/25)
- foley reinserted 6/23/25
- Failed a voiding trial on 7/16/25, re-inserted on 7/17/25
- Foley exchanged 7/29/25, continue to monitor

# Normocytic Anemia: stable, HGB stable, no bleeding
- Hgb ranges 8-10
- Transfuse as needed for goal Hgb > 7 

# I.D. 
Sputum AmpC+ Serratia Marcescens: contact isolation.
Citrobacter koseri bacteremia likely contaminant per I.D. 
Monitor for signs of infection.

# Wound/at risk for infection
- L EAR & NOSE:
        -Keep skin clean and dry 
        -Use Allevyn 2x4 to off load pressure and decrease friction from mask 
        straps (Apply directly to straps)

reported to have taken 10-11 Diazepams at home because he was "tired of being 
sick."
 Impression for CHEST SINGLE VIEW , 07/30/25, case 203
Slight costophrenic angle blunting, possibly tiny effusions which
could indicate fluid overload versus underlying scar. Linear
atelectasis/scar at the lung bases. The remainder of the lungs
are clear.

WBC: 7.15 on 8/4/25

RESPIRATORY STATUS: 2L O2 via nasal cannula 

SUBJECTIVE:
Mr. Lee was seen at bedside for dysphagia follow up. He was awake and alert. 

OBJECTIVE: SLP worked with veteran on incentive spirometry again, again he was 
satting at 91 upon entry of SLP and after using IS foe 10 reps his sats were 
97-98, Veteran continues to complain of intermittent shortness of breath. 

SLP worked with water trial and swallow therapy, MR lee participated well with 
all therapy and did experience intermitted dyspnea. He is able to work through 
with breathing/swallow coordination exercises, He trialed  some tsps. of water 
with 5 effortful swallows and got short of breath after 5 swallows so we took a 
break and repeated same for duration of tx. veterans so was at bedside. 
It does not appear safe to resume free water at this time


RECOMMENDATIONS/PLAN OF CARE: If consistent with patient/family/medical team 
goals of care, consider the following: 
1  Continue alternative means of nutrition, hydration, and medication. 
2. Speech pathology will continue to follow closely

Daily Progress Note

ADM Date:   JUN 12,2025 23:34
ID:         78y MALE admitted w/ PNA

ID: David Michael Lee, a 78-year-old male with a complex medical history 
including chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COPD/emphysema, HFpEF, 
atrial fibrillation, and sick sinus syndrome, was transferred from Barstow 
Community Hospital on 06/12/25 for acute on chronic hypoxemic respiratory 
failure, likely secondary to a COPD exacerbation and community-acquired 
pneumonia. He had also overdosed on diazepam, leading to acute metabolic 
encephalopathy and suicidal ideation, which has since resolved. His 
respiratory status has been managed with AVAPS and BiPAP therapy, and he has 
been weaned to 2L NC oxygen. Despite a history of hypotension, his cardiac 
conditions, including HFpEF and atrial fibrillation, are stable with 
adjustments in medication. Nutritionally, he is supported by a PEG tube due to 
dysphagia and aspiration risk, with speech therapy ongoing. He has a stable 
normocytic anemia and is being monitored for infections, including AmpC+ 
Serratia marcescens. A liver mass and incidental lung nodule require further 
evaluation. His code status was changed to FULL CODE by his son. 
Pt's encephalpathy has been improving and likely has reached to his baseline 
of having memory issue. 

Patient unable to ambulate due to weakness, generalized.  He remains on 2L/NC. 
He denies chest pain, sob or pain. 

PE RN: Patient refused to wear AVAPS mask

Patient states that he feels all right
Denies chest pain shortness of breath
Denies fever
Occasional dry cough present
No vomiting or abdominal pain

has PEG tube, AVAPS machine, and is AmpC+ in sputum), and that son's 
preference was Highland Palms SNF (or Citrus Nursing which was on a VA-
contract "hold" at the time). For status of SNF search, please see this SW's note 
of 7/31/25. On 8/1/25 patient's son expressed concerns with patient's medical care 
and requested a multidisciplinary meeting. 

INTERVENTION:
SW was ultimately able to schedule a meeting for 8/3/25 at 11am at bedside with 
pulmonary, attending, asst nurse manager and social worker.

Daily Progress Note

ADM Date:   JUN 12,2025 23:34
ID:         78y MALE admitted w/ PNA

ID: David Michael Lee, a 78-year-old male with a complex medical history 
including chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COPD/emphysema, HFpEF, 
atrial fibrillation, and sick sinus syndrome, was transferred from Barstow 
Community Hospital on 06/12/25 for acute on chronic hypoxemic respiratory 
failure, likely secondary to a COPD exacerbation and community-acquired 
pneumonia. He had also overdosed on diazepam, leading to acute metabolic 
encephalopathy and suicidal ideation, which has since resolved. His 
respiratory status has been managed with AVAPS and BiPAP therapy, and he has 
been weaned to 2L NC oxygen. Despite a history of hypotension, his cardiac 
conditions, including HFpEF and atrial fibrillation, are stable with 
adjustments in medication. Nutritionally, he is supported by a PEG tube due to 
dysphagia and aspiration risk, with speech therapy ongoing. He has a stable 
normocytic anemia and is being monitored for infections, including AmpC+ 
Serratia marcescens. A liver mass and incidental lung nodule require further 
evaluation. His code status was changed to FULL CODE by his son. 
Pt's encephalpathy has been improving and likely has reached to his baseline 
of having memory issue. 

Patient unable to ambulate due to weakness, generalized.  He remains on 2L/NC. 
He denies chest pain, sob or pain. 

States, "I am waiting for a new place to go" 
He mentions, " I do not have any family"
When asked about his son, he does not remember the last time he spoke with son. 
He states, " I do not know where he is, he does not pick up my calls"

Daily Progress Note

ADM Date:   JUN 12,2025 23:34
ID:         78y MALE admitted w/ PNA

ID: David Michael Lee, a 78-year-old male with a complex medical history 
including chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COPD/emphysema, HFpEF, 
atrial fibrillation, and sick sinus syndrome, was transferred from Barstow 
Community Hospital on 06/12/25 for acute on chronic hypoxemic respiratory 
failure, likely secondary to a COPD exacerbation and community-acquired 
pneumonia. He had also overdosed on diazepam, leading to acute metabolic 
encephalopathy and suicidal ideation, which has since resolved. His 
respiratory status has been managed with AVAPS and BiPAP therapy, and he has 
been weaned to 2L NC oxygen. Despite a history of hypotension, his cardiac 
conditions, including HFpEF and atrial fibrillation, are stable with 
adjustments in medication. Nutritionally, he is supported by a PEG tube due to 
dysphagia and aspiration risk, with speech therapy ongoing. He has a stable 
normocytic anemia and is being monitored for infections, including AmpC+ 
Serratia marcescens. A liver mass and incidental lung nodule require further 
evaluation. His code status was changed to FULL CODE by his son. 
Pt's encephalpathy has been improving and likely has reached to his baseline 
of having memory issue. 

Patient unable to ambulate due to weakness, generalized.  Heart rate increased 
upon low trending of blood pressure.  Patient was moved from out of bed to chair
 He remains on 2L/NC. 
He denies chest pain, sob or pain.

EXCERPT FROM HOSPITALIST'S PROGRESS NOTE 7/29/25:
"David Michael Lee is a 78 year old male with PMH sig for chronic hypoxemic 
respiratory failure in the setting of COPD/emphysema on 2L NC, HFpEF (5/21/25: 
EF 55-60%), a fib and sick sinus syndrome s/p Biotronik dual chamber pacemaker 
on Rivaroxaban, HTN, HLD, OSA, LLE DVT, and anxiety transferring from Barstow 
Community Hospital on 06/12/25 for acute on chronic hypoxemic respiratory 
failure, likely 2/2 COPD exacerbation in the setting of CAP. He was also 
reported to have taken 10-11 Diazepams at home because he was "tired of being 
sick."
 Impression for CHEST SINGLE VIEW , 07/30/25, case 203
Slight costophrenic angle blunting, possibly tiny effusions which
could indicate fluid overload versus underlying scar. Linear
atelectasis/scar at the lung bases. The remainder of the lungs
are clear.

WBC: 8.18on 7/31/25

RESPIRATORY STATUS: 2L O2 via nasal cannula 

SUBJECTIVE:
Mr. Lee was seen at bedside for dysphagia follow up. He was awake and alert. 

OBJECTIVE: SLP worked with veteran on incentive spirometry again, again he was 
satting at 91 upon entry of SLP and after using IS foe 10 reps his sats were 
97-98, Veteran continues to complain of intermittent shortness of breath. 
SLP suggests holding PO water at this time, and continue with swallow therapy 
and incentive spirometry 

RECOMMENDATIONS/PLAN OF CARE: If consistent with patient/family/medical team 
goals of care, consider the following: 
1  Continue alternative means of nutrition, hydration, and medication. 
2. Speech pathology will continue to follow closely
